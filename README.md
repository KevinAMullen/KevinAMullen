- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KevinAMullen
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things environments. Air Quality and water quality are my prime concerns at the moment. I am chair of Climate Response Ireland.
Our website is climateresponse.ie, a work in progress.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how to identify gases using a variety of sensors.
- I have been the recipient of lots of the work by others on Github but have not done any contributions yet - July 2021
-There are a couple of projects that I am involved in that may provide useful opensource code for others. 
- I also have one or two projects of my own that I have completed when I get a moment I will publish them on github.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... when it is worthwhile I will publish how to reach me here.
